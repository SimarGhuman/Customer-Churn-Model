# Customer-Churn-Model
Built a machine learning model using python , scikit learn and artificial neural network and achieved 86% accuracy .
Libraries used are pandas,numpy and tensorflow.
A Churn dataset was used which had data of around 10,000 customers.
The first step was data preprocessing.
Then the ANN were built.
After that we traineed the model and predictions were made.
At last we made the confusion matrix and achieved an accuracy of 86% .
